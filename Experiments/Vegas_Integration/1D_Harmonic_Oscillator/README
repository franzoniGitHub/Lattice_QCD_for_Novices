############## WARMUP to LATTICE QCD: Harmonic Oscillator ###############

The purpose of this code is to reproduce the first excercise in Lepage's
article "Lattice QCD for Novices". A harmonic oscillator is explicitely
path integrated in order to provide estimates of its zero energy and eigenfunction.
The integration is performed via the Vega routine, as implemented in the GSL
library.

REQUIREMENTS to compute the results: g++ compiler and working GSL installation.
REQUIREMENTS to plot the results: either ROOT (Cern) or a working Python installation.

HOW TO BUILD AND RUN
 -Check and set the parameters in SETTINGS.h
 -Execute the script BUILD.sh
   $ ./BUILD.sh
 -Run the executable
   $ ./executable
 -Check the output file

HOW TO PLOT
 -Using ROOT
   $ root plot_macro.cpp
 -Using Python
   $ python plot_macro.py

HOW TO CLEAN
 -Remove all the output \n
   $ ./CLEAN.sh
 -NOTE: plots and output files are deleted in this procedure

FURTHER INFORMATION may be found in the Doxygen html documentation in
the "documentation" directory.
