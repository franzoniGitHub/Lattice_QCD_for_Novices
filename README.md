# Lattice QCD for Novices

## Introduction

This repository contains the source codes and worked experiments of the exercises proposed in "Lattice QCD for Novices" by G.P. Lepage.
The original paper can be downloaded at the following link on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0506036v1).

## Structure

The repository is organized in the following main directories:
1. Vegas_Integration: source code for the first exercise of the paper on the Vegas integration of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator
2. 1D_Path_Integration: source code for the second set of exercises on the Metropolis algorithm of a 1D quantum system
3. QCD: source code for the third set of exercises on the Metropolis algorithm for gluonic path integrals
4. Experiments: this directory contains the worked exercises using the codes described in the points from 1 to 3

## Documentation

More detailed code documentations may be found in the code directories (Vegas_Integration, 1D_Path_Integration, QCD) in the "documentation" directory as a html, Doxygen-generated documentation.
