############## WARMUP to LATTICE QCD: 1D Montecarlo Path Integration ###############

 The purpose of this code is to reproduce the second excercise in Lepage's
 article "Lattice QCD for Novices". A 1D quantum system is path integrated
 using the Montecarlo algorithm in order to provide estimates of first
 excited state energy gap.

 The source code is composed of five files: SETTINGS.h, CUSTOM.h, Metropolis.h, Metropolis.cpp and 1D_path_integral.cpp
 The plot routines are given in two versions: plot_macro.cpp and plot_macro.py.

 REQUIREMENTS
  - To compute the results: g++ compiler
  - To plot the results: either ROOT (download at https://root.cern/install/) or a working Python installation.

 HOW TO BUILD AND RUN
  - It is suggested to create a copy of the 1D_path_integral directory, so as to keep
    the sequence of experiments separated
  - Provide the system definition and the required observables in CUSTOM.h
  - Check and set the parameters in SETTINGS.h
  - Execute the script BUILD.sh \n
    $ ./BUILD.sh
  - Run the executable \n
    $ ./executable
  - Check the output file

 HOW TO PLOT
  - Using ROOT
    $ root plot_macro.C
  - Using Python
    $ python plot_macro.py

 HOW TO CLEAN
  - Remove all the output \n
    $ ./CLEAN.sh
  - NOTE: plots and output files are deleted in this procedure
